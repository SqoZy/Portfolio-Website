A fun and challenging 3-match game made during my first year college years. This project was a team endeavor and was developed using JavaScript.

The objective of the game is to match three or more tiles of the same type to score points. The game features various levels with increasing difficulty and special tiles that add unique gameplay mechanics.

This game was one of my early projects in JavaScript, and it helped me learn a lot about game development and coding in general. The game was created using p5.js, and most of the art assets were sourced from the internet, with some custom modifications to fit the game's theme.
